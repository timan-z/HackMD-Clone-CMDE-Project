DO THIS ONCE I FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIRE <CollaborationPlugin> TO MY CUSTOM <RemoteCursorOverlay> SETUP!!!

I want to integrate Socket.IO BACK into my project (remnants of which can be seen in Server.js and my /mde-part1 repo) 
for the purposes of non-doc real-time features like:
- Chat Messages
- Notifications
- Live Presence Indicators (e.g., [Insert Username] is editing)
Possibly also:
- Live Chat Sidebar (something that can pop up and layer over the render panel).
- Active Users List (box pop-up over the whole webpage).

AFTER THAT:
Figure out how I want to complete this project:
- Still aiming for some kind of accounts and authentication feature.
- Possibly something with SQL for storing and saving different editing sessions.

**Maybe** but really not high priority:
- Integrate some 3rd-party software that can help me complete the "Insert Table" functionality in the toolbar
(it's kind of impossible without some sort of external 3rd-party software).
