// REGISTER PAGE (will be pretty similar structurally to Login.jsx):
/* NOTE: ^ Maybe I can change the design afterwards when all the core functionality is finished. Similar to how
the Github Registration page is super fancy compared to the Login one...*/

// ^ Yeah, I'm going to base the design here off of GitHub's Registration page. So the "Sign Up" stuff will all be on the right-hand side of the webpage
